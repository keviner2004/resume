I'm was a software development manager in Contribulet which is a startup company focusing on fundraising and local business. Unlike the traditional fundraising platform which the donation is from donors directly, Contribulet provides a new way for fundraising. The merchants will donate a portion of its sales to fundraisers.

Imagine you order burgers from the fast food store and that cost you $10, the store may donate $2 to fundraising events you supported via Contribulet. Contribulet connects merchants, fundraisers, and customers together to make the fundraising easier and bring customers to merchants.
