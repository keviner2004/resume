#####Fantasia

When I was a senior student in National Chiao Tung University in the Spring of 2013, I joined the Imagine Cup game competition with my college classmates. The competition had multiple stages include local final and worldwide final. We developed a music rhythm game with RPG elements named Fantasia and won 2nd price in Taiwan local final with the game. In Fantasia, players play Mr. Music to save the corrupted world. To defeat these enemies showed on the top of screen, player need to hit these falling buttons at the right time.

We also provided the multiplayer mode in our game. The other player can use his/her Windows Phone to join the game by scanning the QR code on the screen. By shaking the phone, 2nd player can hit the falling objects on the last track. In the multiplayer mode, monsters would cast evil magic sometimes. When the magic is casted, a toxic cloud will appear on the screen. 2nd player can blow away the cloud by blowing the microphone on the phone.
